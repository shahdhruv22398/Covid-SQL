# 🦠 COVID-19 SQL Analytics

Analyze global COVID-19 trends using **SQL** to uncover insights on infection spread, mortality, and vaccination progress.

---

## 📊 Overview
Two datasets were used for this analysis:
- `CovidDeaths.xlsx` – cases & deaths by location/date  
- `CovidVaccinations.xlsx` – vaccinations by location/date  

The goal: identify key trends in global COVID-19 data, explore regional differences, and quantify vaccination impact through SQL-based analysis.

---

## 🎯 Key Questions
- What is the global **death rate**, and how has it changed over time?  
- Which **continents and countries** recorded the highest deaths and infection rates?  
- How do **vaccinations** correlate with infection and mortality trends?  

---

## ⚙️ How to Run
1. Convert Excel files to CSV (or import directly into your SQL engine).  
2. Create tables: `covid_deaths` and `covid_vax`.  
3. Execute `Covid Project.sql` to generate KPIs and analytical views.  
4. *(Optional)* Connect **Tableau** or **Power BI** for interactive dashboards.

---

## 📈 Key Metrics
- **Death Rate (%)** = total_deaths / total_cases  
- **Cases & Deaths per 100k population**  
- **% Population Vaccinated**  

---

## 📂 Files
- `Covid Project.sql` – main analysis queries  
- `CovidDeaths.xlsx`, `CovidVaccinations.xlsx` – source datasets  

---

## 🚀 Next Steps
- Add **Tableau dashboard screenshots** and key visual insights  
- Publish top **5 analytical findings** (e.g., highest infection rates by country, vaccination impact)
