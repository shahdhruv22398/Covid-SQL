# 🦠 COVID-19 SQL Analytics

Analyze global COVID-19 trends using **SQL** with two datasets:
- `CovidDeaths.xlsx` – cases & deaths by location/date  
- `CovidVaccinations.xlsx` – vaccinations by location/date  

---

## 🎯 Key Questions
- What is the global **death rate** and how has it changed over time?  
- Which **continents and countries** recorded the highest deaths and infections per capita?  
- How does **vaccination progress** correlate with deaths and cases?

---

## ⚙️ How to Run
1. Convert Excel files to CSV (or import directly into your SQL engine).  
2. Create tables: `covid_deaths` and `covid_vax`.  
3. Execute `Covid Project.sql` to calculate KPIs and create analytical views.  
4. *(Optional)* Connect Tableau or Power BI for interactive dashboards.

---

## 📈 Key Metrics
- **Death Rate (%)** = total_deaths / total_cases  
- **Cases & Deaths per 100k population**  
- **% Population Vaccinated**  

---

## 📂 Files
- `Covid Project.sql` – main analysis queries  
- `CovidDeaths.xlsx`, `CovidVaccinations.xlsx` – source datasets
